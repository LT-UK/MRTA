# MRTA
A serial of multi-robot task allocation algorithms.
Multi-agent systems, task/resource allocation.

## Basic infomation

This Python project is originally corresponding to the PhD thesis:
    
    Title: Efficient Decentralised Task Allocation for Multiple Aerial Robots
    
    Academic year: 2017 -- 2020
    
    Author: Teng Li
    
    Supervisors: Prof. Hyo-Sang Shin
                 Prof. Antonios Tsourdos
    
    Affiliation: Centre for AI, Robotics and Space, FEAS,
                 Cranfield University

Language:
    Python 3.12


The simulation scenario is based on a multi-target surveillance mission using multiple UAVs.
The utility function is submodular. 

The proposed algorithms can provide a theoretical optimality guarantee.

Please note that the algorithms are upgraded time to time according to reviewers comments. 
Some of the codes/comments are outdated, users of this repo may contact the author if you enconter any bugs.
